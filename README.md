# Satrap

##### Satrap is a cross-platform Management tool for SSH (GUI-client). It gives you a convenient way to save all your servers and start SSH sessions, without locking you into a specific platform.

⚠️ With Version 0.3.0 and onwards I will try to provide migration files for the local database. 
Satrap is however in heavy active development and things may break.

## Features
* Configure your Servers and Jump Hosts for your SSH Connections
* User and Tag Management for easy changes and filtering
* Start a terminal SSH-Connection with the click of a button
* Check your system's environment variables
* Available for Windows, Mac and Linux

## Plans
* script management
* Open-source backend to synchronize your configurations across machines
* And more...
