# Satrap

### Satrap is a cross-platform SSH-Management tool (GUI-client). Never remember server URLs and users again.

## Satrap is in active development an update compatibility is not guaranteed. Stuff will break.

## Features
* Start a terminal SSH-Connection with the URL and user you have configured
* Check your system's environment variables
* Available for Windows, Mac and Linux

## Plans
* In the future Satrap aims to solve more tasks which frequently block productivity in the development, devops and
selfhosted space.
